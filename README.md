# PacketParser
#### A modular homelab helper

This project is designed to help manage homelabs from outside home networks. It will change forms as I work on it and hopefully in the end it will be a useful piece of software.

The general idea is to have a low-power device inside your home network listening for connections from outside through a single open port (thus lowering the attack surface). Then, the device can take action based on the instructions it receives from the internet. 



#### Major planned features:
- [ ] Configuration files
- [ ] Wol Relay
- [ ] Ping Module
