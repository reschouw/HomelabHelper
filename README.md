# Homelab Helper
#### A modular homelab helper integrated with Slack

This project is designed to help manage homelabs from outside of home networks. It will change forms as I work on it and hopefully in the end it will be a useful piece of software.

The general idea is to have a low-power device (A Raspberry Pi perhaps?) inside your home network running the code for a slack bot. This device can then take actions within your home network such as WOL, etc.



#### Major planned features:
- [X] Slack integration
- [X] Configuration files
- [X] Wol Module
- [ ] Ping Module
- [ ] Wake Module
- [ ] Queue Module
- [ ] Run as Daemon or system service

#### Possible additional features
- [ ] SNMP Query Module (if feasible)
